## Distillation Background:
Distillation is the most frequent unit operation for converting liquid mixtures into valuable and high-purity products.It is usually the most economical method of separating liquids,superior to the extraction,adsorption and crystallization techniques.Solving the Material balance, Equilibrium, Summation, and Heat balance equations step-by-step is the standard method for resolving a common multi-component distillation problem. Shortcut methods are still helpful in the initial design work and as a tool for defining problems for computer simulation, even though computer programs are typically available for the rigorous solution of the MESH equations. This application uses the Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland (FUG) method, a widely used suitable distillation technique.

## User Interface Description
User interface in the Application for choosing the compounds:
<br/><img src='/images/profile.png'>
### 1. Number of Components (min =2,max = 5):
In this we need to input the number of components for the distillation column max upto 5 components
### 2.Component 1 or 2:
The Component-1 and Component-2 are the two compounds which we have to choose to calculate the volatility and observer their relative volatility for the range of Temperature
### 3.Feed Percentage:
In this box we need to enter the feed percentage of all the components which sums to 100 %
### 4.Heavy Key:
Choose the component next to the light key which has the immediate highest boiling point which will be recovered in the bottoms from the order in the table (Data Table of the constants and Boiling Points in ascending order)
