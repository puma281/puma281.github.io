## Distillation Background:
Distillation is the most frequent unit operation for converting liquid mixtures into valuable and high-purity products.It is usually the most economical method of separating liquids,superior to the extraction,adsorption and crystallization techniques.Solving the Material balance, Equilibrium, Summation, and Heat balance equations step-by-step is the standard method for resolving a common multi-component distillation problem. Shortcut methods are still helpful in the initial design work and as a tool for defining problems for computer simulation, even though computer programs are typically available for the rigorous solution of the MESH equations. This application uses the Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland (FUG) method, a widely used suitable distillation technique.
