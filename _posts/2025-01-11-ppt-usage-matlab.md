Dealing with a lot of figures can be quite challenging. You have to analyze multiple figures at once. Saving them as images and opening all the images to compare them can be quite tedious. Also, you have to create a PowerPoint presentation to show them to someone again. It might seem overwhelming and boring after a long and exhausting coding process to generate these figures.

Here comes the reportgenerator package in MATLAB to rescue us from these issues. It generates a report from a given code. But who makes a report in MATLAB, hmm? I use LaTeX sometimes, Word though for smaller reports. But yeah, you heard it true: MATLAB can generate reports, but we will use this technique to create PowerPoint files from the ton of images that are produced in the codes.
