Isoprene is a major VOC emitted by plants <a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> . It plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, accounting for a significant share of VOC emissions from plants, and it also controls ozone production in the atmosphere.

Isoprene can be detected by the benzene CIMS.But this appears as two ions in the mass spec C5H8 & C11H14 with the later being much higher in amount.
