The raw data of CIMS can be pretty huge at times leading to 4-5 GB of data. Hence it is important to organize the data neatly and have a code repository to convert the raw h5 files into the .mat files which can be used further. 

This [folder](https://wustl.app.box.com/folder/289860503849?s=87c1rrurb7ppev895tfqbde3tlshotg7) has the documents showing how to step wisely do the data organization.
