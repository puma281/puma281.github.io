Isoprene is a major VOC emitted by plants. It plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, accounting for a significant share of VOC emissions from plants, and it also controls ozone production in the atmosphere.

Isoprene can be detected by the benzene CIMS.

Here's how you can ensure your plotting criteria are met, with proper alignment of coordinates specified as vectors or matrices of compatible dimensions. This means ensuring the dimensions of your input variables align appropriately. Below is an example of using both a vector and a matrix that share a common dimension:

<pre>
% Example matrix and 1-dimensional array
A = rand(10, 3);    % Example 2D matrix with 10 rows and 3 columns
x = linspace(0, 1, 10)';  % Example 1D array with 10 elements (transposed to a column vector)

% Using a single plot command, ensuring dimensions align
figure;  % Create a new figure
% Replicate the column vector x across columns to match matrix A dimensions
x_repeated = repmat(x, 1, size(A, 2));
plot(x_repeated, A);
xlabel('x');
ylabel('Values');
