* M.Tech in  Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay, 2023 (expected)
* M.Sc in Aerosol Science & Engineering, Washington University in St.Louis, 2023 (expected)

Projects
========
# Web applications for basic chemical engineering calculations
## Shiny Web application Distillation Column
* Created a model to predict the number of stages in a distillation column by implementing Antoine and FUG equations
* Devised web application in R shiny using shortcut distillation model that takes input feed quality, distillate and bottoms recovery and determines the relative volatility, minimum reflux ratio and minimum number of plates required

## Vapour pressure calculation using Antoine Equation
* Created a shiny web based application to predict the vapour pressure and the relative volatility for 50 important chemical compounds 

## Pump calculations
