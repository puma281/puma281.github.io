Education
======
* B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay, 2023 (expected)
* M.Tech in  Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay, 2023 (expected)
* M.Sc in Aerosol Science & Engineering, Washington University in St.Louis, 2023 (expected)

Projects
========
## Web applications for basic chemical engineering calculations
### Shiny Web application Distillation Column
* Created a model to predict the number of stages in a distillation column by implementing Antoine and FUG equations
* Devised web application in R shiny using shortcut distillation model that takes input feed quality, distillate and bottoms recovery and determines the relative volatility, minimum reflux ratio and minimum number of plates required

### Vapour pressure calculation using Antoine Equation
* Created a shiny web based application to predict the vapour pressure and the relative volatility for 50 important chemical compounds 

## Study on Renewable Hydrogen Production Technologies
* Surveyed and reviewed the existing renewable hydrogen production technologies (HPTs) from 35 unique articles
* Estimated the efficiency of production technologies by developing a MATLAB program for fuzzy TOPSIS method
* Built decision-making matrix for 10 different criteria corresponding to economic, environmental, and technological aspects defined by 7 worst-to-best variables and their corresponding fuzzy numbers
* Assessed performance of different renewable production technologies based on current hydrogen market demand

## Water Conservation Project 
* Worked under the sub-project analysis of Behavioral change of stakeholders towards water consumption at hostels
* Identified the major users of water supplied and the chief point sources of wastage of water in the hostel canteen
* Solicited data through qualitative and quantitative interviews and fabricated raw data through multiple observations
* Compiled 60-page report with methodology, analysis, literature review, and solutions for the water wastage in hostel

## Yield improvement of Mancozeb
* Visited the Mancozeb plant at Dahej, gaining insights about plant operations and processes from experts in the field
* Identified the shortcomings in lower production by calculating yield at each stage of process by material balances
* Built a representative model for the operating industrial precipitation reactor according to the impeller geometry
* Proposed changes in operating conditions by analyzing velocity, shear stress in reactor by using the CFD analysis

## Life Cycle Assessment of Rubber Tyres
* Assessed production methodologies and fuel characterization of rubber tires from waste tires produced in India
* Estimated the carbon emission characteristics of the car tire in the life cycle stages mainly focusing on the end-of-life waste passenger tires  using the OpenLCA software
