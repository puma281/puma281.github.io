Hello, I am a fifth year Dual Degree student in the Department of Chemical Engineering Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB).

A long story...
======
I absolutely love watching cricket, it's a sport that has always fascinated me. The adrenaline rush when my favorite team is playing, the excitement of close matches, and the anticipation of every run scored or wicket taken, make it an enthralling experience.

Playing hockey is another passion of mine. The thrill of being on the field, the sound of the ball hitting the stick, and the camaraderie among the team members make it an invigorating experience. Hockey also keeps me physically active and challenges me to push my limits, making it a fulfilling and enjoyable sport for me.

Running in the evening is a routine that I look forward to every day. As the sun starts to set, I lace up my running shoes and head out to hit the pavement. The fresh air, the rhythmic sound of my footsteps, and the stunning colors of the sky during sunset create a serene ambiance. It's my time to reflect, clear my mind, and recharge after a long day. Watching the beautiful sunsets while running adds a touch of magic to my workout routine and helps me connect with nature.

And when I have some free time to relax and unwind, I love watching Amrutham, the OG Telugu comedy sitcom. The show never fails to put a smile on my face with its hilarious characters, witty dialogues, and comical situations. I enjoy the antics of Amrutham and Anji as they navigate through their misadventures, and the eccentricities of characters like Sanju, Appaji, and Sarvam always leave me in splits. It's a show that has a special place in my heart, and I find it a perfect stress-reliever after a long day.
