Hello, I am a fifth year Dual Degree student in the Department of Chemical Engineering Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB).

A long story...
======
I really enjoy watching cricket—it's a sport that totally grabs my attention. The thrill when my favorite team is on the field, the excitement of a match that’s neck and neck, and the eagerness for every run or wicket make it so captivating for me.

Hockey is another favorite of mine. Being on the field, hearing the ball hit the stick, and being part of a team is exhilarating. Hockey keeps me moving and pushes me to my limits, making it a fun and rewarding sport.

Every evening, I look forward to my run. As the sun goes down, I lace up my shoes and hit the road. The fresh air, the rhythm of my steps, and the beautiful sunset colors create a peaceful vibe. It’s my time to relax, clear my head, and recharge after a busy day. Running while enjoying the sunset adds a magical touch to my routine and helps me feel connected to nature.

When I have some downtime, I love watching Amrutham, a classic Telugu comedy show. It always makes me laugh with its funny characters, clever dialogues, and hilarious situations. I get a kick out of Amrutham and Anji’s misadventures, and characters like Sanju, Appaji, and Sarvam always crack me up. This show holds a special place in my heart and is a perfect way to unwind after a long day.
